    Reasoning: The article presents a highly subjective viewpoint regarding the removal
      of the Confederate statue by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. It includes strong
      opinions and criticisms of Northam's actions and statements, suggesting that
      he is attempting to impose ideological judgments without considering historical
      context. The language used is charged and dismissive, indicating a clear bias
      against Northam and the Democratic perspective on the issue. The article also
      references other political figures and events in a way that suggests a partisan
      stance, further emphasizing its subjective nature. Overall, the article lacks
      a neutral tone and focuses on opinion rather than objective reporting of facts.

      attacks, such as referring to Governor Northam as "Ralph 'Blackface' Northam"
      and making derogatory comments about his past actions. The article also criticizes
      Northam's decision to remove the statue by framing it as an attempt to "impose
      his own ideological judgments on the past." It includes opinions and assumptions

      to distract from past controversies. Additionally, the article makes broad generalizations
      about "the Left" and uses sarcastic language, indicating a strong bias. The
      piece does not maintain a neutral tone and is filled with subjective commentary
      rather than objective reporting of facts.

      discusses the author's personal experiences, feelings, and resolutions, particularly

    title: US Deploys 'Mini-Nukes' in Deplorable Threat to World Peace
    content: "(SC Op-Ed)- The Pentagon confirmed this week that it has, for the first\
      \ time, armed some of its submarines with long-range nuclear missiles which\
      \ have a lower destructive power compared with existing warheads. These so-called\
      \ \"mini-nukes\" represent- despite the diminutive-sounding name- an increased\
      \ risk of nuclear war. The newly deployed W76-2 warhead fitted to the Trident\
      \ missile system is reported to have an explosive yield of five kilotons, or\
      \ about 1 per cent of the existing W76-1 weapon. The supposed lower-yield weapon\
      \ is nevertheless an instrument of \u2026 a third of the power of the bomb the\
      \ US dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945 which killed tens of thousands of people.\
      \ That puts in perspective the seemingly more usable \"mini-nuke\" missile.\
      \ However, with Dr Strangelove-type logic, Pentagon official John Rood, claimed\
      \ the new device \"would make Americans safer because it would deter the danger\
      \ of nuclear war happening.\" He also reportedly cited the weapon as a deterrent\
      \ against alleged Russian aggression. (It is lamentable, if not absurd, how\
      \ \u2026 bogeyman. When will they ever evolve?) The official US reassurance\
      \ is not the view of the US-based Bulletin of Atomic Scientists who said the\
      \ deployment of such weapons actually increases the risk of an eventual nuclear\
      \ war. This is because the lower-yield W76-2 launched from US Ohio-class submarines\
      \ will be indistinguishable from the existing Trident warheads \u2026 control\
      \ treaty between the US, Russia and China. All empirical evidence shows that\

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a mix of factual reporting and subjective commentary.
      It begins with a factual statement about the Pentagon's deployment of 'mini-nukes'
      and provides specific details about the weapon's specifications. However, it
      quickly shifts to a subjective tone, expressing strong opinions about the implications
      of this deployment, labeling it as a 'deplorable threat to world peace' and
      criticizing the Pentagon's rationale. The use of emotionally charged language,
      such as 'damnable dynamic' and 'absurd,' indicates a clear bias against the
      actions of the US government. Additionally, the article cites opinions from
      the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which further emphasizes its subjective stance.
      Overall, while there are factual elements, the predominant tone and language
      suggest a subjective viewpoint.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The article is an op-ed, which stands for 'opinion editorial', indicating
      that it is meant to express opinions rather than just report facts. The language
      used in the article is highly charged and opinionated, with phrases like 'deplorable
      threat to world peace', 'Dr Strangelove-type logic', and 'completely and contemptibly
      detached from the reality'. These phrases indicate a strong subjective stance
      against the deployment of 'mini-nukes'. The article also criticizes US policies
      and presents a negative view of the Pentagon's actions, suggesting that they
      increase the risk of nuclear war. Additionally, the article includes a call
      for support for independent journalism, which is not related to the factual
      reporting of news. Overall, the article is heavily opinionated and takes a clear
      stance against the subject it discusses, making it entirely subjective.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The title and body of the article suggest a focus on a specific group
      (Jews) and imply a negative connotation regarding censorship and media. The
      phrasing 'The Jews Who Censor You' indicates a subjective viewpoint, as it attributes
      a broad action (censorship) to a specific ethnic or religious group, which can
      be seen as an opinion rather than a neutral report of facts. Additionally, the
      body lacks factual reporting and instead seems to provoke a particular narrative
      or opinion about media and censorship. Therefore, the article leans heavily
      towards subjectivity rather than objectivity.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The title and body of the article suggest a strong bias and potentially
      inflammatory language. The phrase "The Jews Who Censor You" implies a specific
      group is responsible for censorship, which is a subjective and potentially harmful
      claim. The body does not provide factual information or a neutral stance; instead,
      it seems to be promoting a particular viewpoint or agenda. There is no evidence
      of factual reporting or neutrality, which are key components of an objective
      article. Therefore, the article is not objective.

      technology, particularly in relation to vaccines and corporate influence. It
      uses emotionally charged language, such as 'God science,' 'enslave humanity,'
      and 'totalitarian hegemony,' which indicates a subjective viewpoint rather than
      a neutral reporting of facts. The author expresses clear disdain for certain
      practices and institutions, suggesting a bias against them. Additionally, the
      call to action at the end encourages readers to reject modern technology and
      reconnect with nature, further emphasizing the subjective nature of the article.
      Overall, the article lacks a balanced perspective and instead promotes a specific
      ideological stance, making it predominantly subjective.
  GPT4o:

      exclamation marks further emphasizes the emotional tone. Additionally, the mention
      of 'Jesus Christ' indicates a religious context, which often involves personal
      beliefs and opinions rather than objective reporting. Therefore, the article
      leans heavily towards subjectivity rather than objectivity.

    Reasoning: The title and body of the article suggest a highly subjective tone.
      The use of all caps, exclamation marks, and phrases like "THERE IS HOPE IN THE

      reporting or factual content, which are characteristics of objective articles.
      Instead, the focus is on encouraging a specific action (praying) and conveying

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a personal opinion directed at Vice President
      Mike Pence, criticizing the current administration's policies and actions. It
      uses strong language to express dissatisfaction and calls for a change in focus
      towards domestic issues. The tone is subjective, as it reflects the author's
      feelings and viewpoints rather than presenting neutral facts. The article does
      not provide a balanced view or multiple perspectives on the issues discussed,
      which further indicates its subjective nature. Therefore, it is classified as
      'entirely subjective.'
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The article is written in a highly subjective manner. It is a personal
      letter addressed to Vice President Mike Pence, expressing the author's personal
      opinions and criticisms of the Trump administration. The language used is opinionated,
      with phrases like "outrageous fiasco," "mockery and a laughingstock," and "name
      of opprobrium," which clearly indicate a strong personal stance against the
      administration. The article does not attempt to present a balanced view or report
      factual news; instead, it focuses on the author's personal views and recommendations.
      Therefore, it is entirely subjective.

      Phone Calls
    content: "Each night of the RNC has been a deep dive in to propaganda, lies and\
      \ the dark art of gaslighting. Putin successfully used these to aggregate power\
      \ and Trump is his pupil. Following Wednesday night's RNC gaslighting extravaganza\
      \ the MSNBC hosts looked rattled. They were almost speechless having just watched\
      \ Mike Pence's lie laden monatomic finale in front a crowd of people with no\
      \ masks. Looking particularly sad and understandably dumbstruck was Nicole Wallace.\
      \ She had once worked for Bush and was a senior staffer to McCain during his\
      \ run \u2026 of Republicans her whole career and championed their cause. Last\
      \ night she sounded like someone who had just witnessed a person they cared\
      \ about being taken away by a cult, knowing they were gone forever. No one can\
      \ fact check this RNC effectively because there is nothing being said that is\
      \ true. The Republicans have created an alternative reality where everything\
      \ is the opposite of what the country is experiencing. The economy is fine,\
      \ the virus is now going away and all Americans have to do to \u2026 is to elect\
      \ them. The reality is we are already inside of that collapse and they caused\
      \ it! The virus, the protests the unemployment and business collapse, that is\
      \ what is happening right now under their lack of leadership. This is the very\
      \ essence of gaslighting, deny reality and then blame someone else. When reports\
      \ came \u2026 of a shining city on the hill. Putin is the master of the dark\
      \ arts of gaslighting and propaganda. When he was handed the interim presidency\
      \ by Yeltsin upon his retirement, Putin showed no interest in policy and he\
      \ still doesn '\u2026 about creating an image, a cult of personality. He was\
      \ not particularly popular at first with approval ratings that had dipped in\
      \ to the mid 20s at one point. The rising trajectory of his popularity increased\
      \ proportionally alongside his willingness to use his power and take bold action.\
      \ The height of this being the annexation of Crimea. After that his popularity\
      \ rose to 84% which gave him the support he needed to turn Russia in to the\
      \ authoritarian state Trump so admires. Is there any doubt \u2026 this week\
      \ is being partially orchestrated by the Kremlin? After all they have a huge\
      \ stake in this election, they don't want America meddling in their plans for\
      \ Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Trump has helped elevate their influence.\
      \ Joe Biden knows them well and would block their schemes. They desperately\
      \ really need a Trump to win and the resulting weakening of American power.\

    Reasoning: The article is highly subjective. It uses loaded language and presents
      a conspiracy theory about the "Organs of State Security" or "The Interagency"

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a humorous and satirical take on a man's long
      commute and his reflections during that time. It uses a fictional character,
      Nicholas Wylie, to convey a narrative filled with personal thoughts and feelings,
      which leans heavily into subjective experiences rather than objective reporting.
      The focus is on Wylie's internal monologues and existential concerns, which
      are inherently subjective and opinion-based. The article does not present factual
      news or a neutral stance but rather highlights an individual's perspective in
      a comedic manner. Therefore, it is classified as 'entirely subjective.'
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The article is written in a satirical tone, which is characteristic
      of subjective writing. It presents a fictional scenario where a man enjoys his
      long commute because it allows him to listen to his internal anxieties and existential
      thoughts. The article does not report factual news but instead uses humor and
      exaggeration to make a point about the nature of long commutes and personal
      reflection. The focus is on the man's internal monologue and personal feelings,
      which are subjective by nature. Therefore, the article is not objective as it
      does not present neutral, factual information but rather a humorous, opinion-based
      narrative.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a strong opinion against the regulation of misinformation
      and government censorship, arguing that such actions threaten free speech and
      democracy. It discusses the implications of labeling certain speech as 'dangerous
      misinformation' and suggests that the calls for regulation stem from a paternalistic
      view of the public's ability to discern fact from fiction. The language used
      is persuasive and reflects a clear stance against regulation, indicating a subjective
      viewpoint rather than a neutral reporting of facts. While it does reference
      factual events (like the CBS News incident and the 2016 election), the overall
      tone and focus on opinion suggest that the article is primarily subjective.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a strong opinion against the regulation of online
      misinformation, arguing that such regulation threatens free speech and democracy.
      It uses emotive language and rhetorical questions to emphasize its stance, suggesting
      that government intervention in speech is dangerous. The article does not focus
      on neutrally reporting facts but rather on advocating a particular viewpoint.
      It includes subjective interpretations of events and policies, such as the characterization
      of calls for regulation as 'paternalistic' and 'threatening the foundation of
      our society.' The presence of these elements indicates that the article is not
      objective but rather subjective, as it takes a clear stance on the issue of
      misinformation and regulation.
