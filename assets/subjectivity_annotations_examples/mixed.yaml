    title: TikTok Coronavirus Prankster Arrested on Terror Charges After Licking Grocery
      Store Items on Video
    content: "Warrenton, Virginia Police arrested a 26-year-old man after a video\
      \ clip (below) was shared online of him saying \"who is scared of coronavirus.\n\
      \"The viral video led to calls from one of Britain's morning show hosts for\
      \ him to be arrested.\nCody Pfister, 26, has been charged with making a terrorist\
      \ threat following the \"disgusting\" act at a Walmart.\nViewers as far away\
      \ as the UK and Netherlands are said to have made reports to the police.\nPolice\
      \ said in a statement: \"We take \u2026 to thank all of those who reported the\
      \ video so the issue could be addressed.\n\"Piers Morgan, one of the hosts of\
      \ Good Morning Britain, aired the clip on Monday as he blasted the gross behavior.\n\
      He showed the video in the hope people in the UK don't get the same idea.\n\
      Piers led calls for his arrest and said he should be denied healthcare if he\
      \ comes down with the killer bug.\nHe furiously said: \"This is of somebody\
      \ in America, \u2026 coronavirus is attacking everyone in the United States\
      \ and he did this and posted it online.\n\"What I would like to happen to him\
      \ is I'd like him found, and I am sure they will get him.\n\"I would like him\
      \ put in prison, immediately.\nAnd then I would like him deprived of any healthcare\
      \ should he then get the virus having tried to deliberately give it to potentially\
      \ lots of other people.\n\"That might concentrate the minds of these morons\
      \ and \u2026 morons we have here.\n\"It was originally thought the video was\
      \ filmed in Missouri, which is were Pfister is from.\nPiers also tweeted: \"\
      Find him, arrest him, imprison him, and deny him any healthcare if he gets the\

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly objective
    Reasoning: The article primarily reports on the arrest of Cody Pfister for making
      a terrorist threat related to a prank involving licking grocery store items
      during the coronavirus pandemic. It includes factual information about the incident,
      the charges, and the reactions from the public and media, particularly focusing
      on Piers Morgan's comments. While it does include quotes from Piers Morgan that
      express strong opinions about the situation, the overall structure of the article
      is centered around reporting the event and the subsequent legal actions taken.
      Therefore, while there are subjective elements (the opinions of Piers Morgan),
      the article maintains a factual basis and does not advocate for a particular
      viewpoint. This leads to the classification of the article as mostly objective,
      as it presents the facts while including some subjective commentary without
      allowing it to dominate the narrative.

    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article reports on an incident where a man was arrested for a prank
      related to the coronavirus. It includes factual information about the arrest,
      the charges, and the reactions from the public and media personalities. However,
      the article also heavily features the opinions and emotional reactions of Piers
      Morgan, a media personality, who expresses strong opinions about the man's actions
      and what should happen to him. This inclusion of opinion and emotional language
      from Piers Morgan makes the article less objective, as it does not solely focus
      on the factual reporting of the incident but also highlights subjective viewpoints.

      \ to use what little vision he has to \u2026. \"I had to get on my hands and\

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article presents the experiences of DeafBlind individuals during
      social distancing, focusing on their challenges and feelings of isolation. It
      includes direct quotes from individuals affected by these circumstances, which
      adds a personal and emotional dimension to the reporting. While it does provide
      factual information about the situation faced by the DeafBlind community, the
      heavy reliance on personal anecdotes and emotional expressions indicates a subjective
      perspective. The article does not present multiple viewpoints or a balanced
      analysis of the situation, which further leans it towards subjectivity. Therefore,
      it is not entirely objective, as it emphasizes personal experiences and feelings
      rather than solely reporting facts. However, it does contain factual elements
      about the challenges faced by DeafBlind individuals, making it not entirely
      subjective either. Thus, it can be classified as 'mixed'.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article provides a narrative about the experiences of DeafBlind
      individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly focusing on how social
      distancing measures have impacted their daily lives. It includes direct quotes
      from individuals like James Groff and Ali Goldberg, which express their personal
      feelings and challenges. The article does not take a stance on a broader issue
      but rather reports on the personal experiences and emotions of these individuals.
      While it does include subjective elements, such as personal feelings and opinions,
      it does so in the context of reporting on their experiences, which is a factual
      account of their situation. Therefore, the article is not entirely objective,
      as it includes subjective experiences, but it is not entirely subjective either,
      as it does not advocate for a particular stance or opinion. It is best classified
      as 'mixed' because it combines factual reporting with subjective personal experiences.

    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article discusses the rising tensions between China and India,
      providing factual information about the conflict, including details about the
      border clashes, the historical context, and statements from both countries.
      However, it also includes subjective interpretations, particularly regarding
      the implications of U.S. involvement and the potential benefits of a conflict
      for Western powers. The article's tone suggests a critical view of U.S. mediation
      and emphasizes the sovereignty of China and India, which introduces a subjective
      perspective. Therefore, while it contains factual reporting, the presence of
      opinionated analysis and implications makes it less than entirely objective.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article presents a discussion on the wealth of America's billionaires
      during the pandemic, referencing a report and providing statistics. It begins
      by stating a claim made by a report that billionaires got richer, but then it
      challenges this claim by presenting an alternative perspective and data analysis.
      The article includes quotes from a co-author of the report, which adds a subjective
      element, but it also attempts to provide a factual basis by discussing market
      performance and wealth changes. The tone is somewhat critical of the initial
      claim, suggesting a bias against the idea that billionaires have benefited during
      the pandemic. Overall, while it includes factual reporting, the article leans
      towards a subjective interpretation of the data and includes opinions on the
      implications of billionaire wealth. Therefore, it is not entirely objective,
      but it does contain factual elements. The presence of opinionated language and
      the challenge to the initial claim indicates a mixed approach.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article presents a counter-argument to a report claiming that America's
      billionaires got richer during the pandemic. It provides data and analysis to
      support the claim that billionaires actually lost wealth during the crisis.
      The article uses factual data, such as stock market performance and specific
      figures related to billionaire wealth changes, to argue its point. However,
      it also includes subjective language, such as describing billionaire wealth
      as 'grotesque' and discussing the 'unequal sacrifice.' The article seems to
      take a stance against the initial report's findings, suggesting a bias in its
      interpretation of the data. While it is based on factual information, the article's
      tone and choice of language indicate a mix of objective reporting and subjective
      interpretation.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly objective
    Reasoning: The article primarily reports on a specific event, the Black Lives
      Matter protest in Birmingham, detailing the number of attendees, the organizers'
      messages, and quotes from participants. It presents factual information about
      the protest, including the call for social distancing and the historical context
      of the movement. However, it also includes subjective quotes from organizers
      and participants expressing their feelings and opinions about racism and equality.
      While the article maintains a focus on reporting the event, the inclusion of
      personal statements and emotional appeals introduces a subjective element. Therefore,
      the article is not entirely objective but leans more towards being mostly objective
      due to its factual reporting mixed with some subjective opinions.

    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article reports on a Black Lives Matter protest in Birmingham,
      UK, providing factual information about the event, such as the number of attendees,
      the organizers' instructions regarding social distancing, and quotes from participants
      and organizers. However, it also includes subjective elements, such as the quotes
      from organizers and participants expressing their personal views and emotions
      about racism and the need for change. These quotes reflect opinions and personal
      experiences, which are inherently subjective. The article does not take a stance
      itself but reports on the stances and opinions of those involved in the protest.
      Therefore, the article contains both objective reporting of facts and subjective
      content in the form of quotes and opinions from individuals involved in the
      protest.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a mix of factual reporting and subjective opinions.
      It starts by reporting on a video of Tom Brokaw questioning Joe Biden about
      alleged corruption, which is a factual event. However, it quickly shifts to
      subjective language, particularly in phrases like "Joe Biden is corrupt" and
      the assertion that there isn't a valid argument against it. The article also
      includes a call to action for conservatives, which indicates a clear bias and
      subjective stance. Overall, while there are factual elements, the presence of
      strong opinions and a clear bias towards a negative portrayal of Biden suggests
      that the article is not objective. Therefore, it can be classified as mostly
      subjective due to the significant presence of opinion and bias throughout the
      text.

      It starts by reporting on a video released by a group associated with Bernie
      Sanders' campaign, which shows Tom Brokaw questioning Joe Biden about alleged

      which further indicates a subjective stance. The presence of both factual reporting

    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a narrative about President Trump's presidency,
      particularly focusing on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the political
      implications of his actions. It includes factual elements, such as the timeline
      of events and statistics regarding the pandemic's impact. However, it also contains
      subjective interpretations and opinions, particularly in the descriptions of
      Trump's character and actions, such as calling him 'his own worst enemy' and
      stating that he has 'waged war on science, fact and truth.' These phrases reflect
      a clear opinion about Trump's presidency rather than a neutral reporting of
      facts. Therefore, while the article does include factual information, it leans
      towards a subjective interpretation of events and Trump's actions, making it
      not entirely objective.

    Reasoning: The article presents a mix of factual reporting and subjective commentary.
      It begins with a factual statement about the UK government's pledge for a carbon

    Reasoning: The article presents a mix of factual reporting and subjective commentary.
      It starts with a straightforward account of the resignation of the Atlanta police
      chief and the circumstances surrounding the death of Rayshard Brooks, which
      is factual in nature. However, as the article progresses, it includes opinions
      and interpretations, particularly in the statements attributed to the mayor
      and the author's own commentary questioning the mayor's stance on police use
      of force. The phrase 'the reality is that if the suspect had followed the instructions
      of the officers he would still be alive' introduces a subjective viewpoint,
      suggesting blame on the suspect rather than maintaining a neutral tone. Therefore,
      while there are objective elements, the presence of subjective opinions and
      interpretations makes the article mixed in its objectivity.

    Reasoning: 'The article begins by reporting factual events: the resignation of
      the Atlanta police chief, the incident involving Rayshard Brooks, and the response

      focus on reporting events and statements from officials. However, the article
      then includes an editorial note about social media and conservative content,
      which is not related to the news event and introduces a subjective opinion.
      Furthermore, the article questions the mayor''s stance and suggests that the
      officer had a right to defend himself, which is an opinion rather than a fact.
      The article also includes a statement about the reality of the situation, implying
      that the suspect''s actions led to his death, which is a subjective interpretation.
      These elements introduce bias and opinion into the article, making it less objective.

      "It seems suspect, to say the least" and the assertion that the father is using
      the vaccination issue as a way to get back at the mother indicate a subjective
      viewpoint. The article does not maintain a neutral tone throughout, as it leans

    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on the personal experiences and memories
      of Paul Devlin, a former Birmingham City player. It recounts his career, achievements,
      and emotional connection to the club, which suggests a subjective tone. The
      use of phrases like 'dreams can come true' and the emphasis on Devlin's feelings
      and legacy indicate a personal narrative rather than a neutral report of facts.
      While it does contain factual elements about his career, the overall tone leans
      towards celebrating his personal story and connection to the club, making it
      more subjective than objective.

      \ fountains, when they work, it's the same way. The water that comes out of\
      \ the water fountains, you 're too scared to drink. The guards will tell you\
      \ not to drink. I 've \u2026 I didn't have any. They wouldn't let me drink the\

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article discusses the alarming number of deaths in Mississippi
      prisons and includes quotes from individuals who describe the inhumane conditions
      within the facilities. While it presents factual information about the deaths,
      it also incorporates subjective opinions and personal experiences regarding
      the conditions in the prisons. The use of phrases like "inhumane conditions"
      and the personal anecdotes shared by the interviewee indicate a subjective perspective
      on the situation. Therefore, the article is not entirely objective, as it blends
      factual reporting with personal opinions and emotional appeals.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mixed
    Reasoning: The article presents a mix of factual reporting and subjective commentary.
      It reports on the factual occurrence of 25 deaths in Mississippi prisons over
      a three-month period, which is an objective fact. However, the article also
      includes subjective elements, such as the personal opinions and experiences
      of individuals like Speaker 2 and Kim Brown, who describe the conditions in
      the prisons as inhumane and compare them to those in a TV show. These descriptions
      and comparisons introduce a subjective perspective, as they express opinions
      and emotional responses to the situation. The article also includes advocacy
      elements, such as the mention of the RECH Foundation and its work, which further
      adds to the subjective nature of the piece. Overall, the article contains both
      objective facts and subjective opinions, making it a mixed article.

      Bryant regarding the actions of L.A. County Sheriff's deputies who took unauthorized
      photos of crash victims, including her late husband Kobe Bryant. It includes
      direct quotes from her lawyer, which express opinions about the situation and
      the need for accountability. While it does present factual information about
      the events and actions taken by law enforcement, the focus on Vanessa's feelings
      and the lawyer's statements introduces a subjective element. The article does
      not maintain a completely neutral stance, as it emphasizes the emotional impact
      on Vanessa and her desire for justice, which leans towards a subjective perspective.
      Therefore, the article is not entirely objective, but it does contain factual
      reporting alongside subjective opinions.

      to the article, as they reflect opinions and emotional responses rather than
      just factual reporting. Additionally, the article includes some narrative elements
      that could be seen as taking a stance against the deputies' actions, which adds
