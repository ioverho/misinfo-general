    title: The Science Behind Hydrogen-Infused Water - Part 2...
    content: "If you missed part 1, watch it here! So let's talk about hydrogen as\
      \ a proven science. And I know you didn't hear about it on the news. You 've\
      \ heard all about all kinds of other political crazy things going on, but we\
      \ never hear about these kinds of things. We 're hearing about, who bought what\
      \ car. How Tesla's doing or whatever. But we don't hear about how, wait a minute,\
      \ we can drink or get hydrogen \u2026 function or cancer going away or whatever.\
      \ But there are 700 plus studies since 2008. Imagine that for a second, 2008,\
      \ it wasn't long ago. We have 700 studies showing H2, to be therapeutic with\
      \ 170 human disease models. Is this significant information? Should it be on\
      \ the news? Yes! It should. You know, I mean, all of these things. So again,\
      \ there's 700 studies. What I want to say before we go \u2026 the outcomes are\
      \ not guaranteed. Okay? Now, these studies are pretty significant, and the language\
      \ is very strong compared to most studies, which say \"maybe, possibly, on a\
      \ Wednesday, some year you might see a benefit.\" Right? Have you ever read\
      \ studies like that? Yeah, so we 're like, \"I don't know \u2026 shows what?\
      \ There it is. It increased gastric ghrelin expression, so it was ghrelin that\
      \ was in the brain that was basically given signal modulation from hydrogen.\
      \ So hydrogen levels didn't change in the brain, but ghrelin did. By what? Hydrogen\
      \ giving direction, and so that's what's important. Now, I told you it helped\
      \ the gut, and we 're \u2026 how water can help the gut. It's actually not hydrogen,\
      \ because your gut's supposed to be producing hydrogen. What this study is showing\
      \ is that if we change the electrical potential of water itself, and it gets\
      \ into the small intestine and changes the epithelial tissue of the lining of\
      \ our gut, then guess what? We selectively stimulate anaerobic microflora. Now\
      \ we 've done some studies, and we can outpace an antibiotic. We can actually\
      \ grow good bacteria faster \u2026 enough, when you 're drinking water with\
      \ hydrogen gas in it. And, when the electrical potential, because the whole\
      \ process creates water that has a -400, -500 millivolts of electrical potential\
      \ in the water and that is what changes the terrain, the biome and makes a new\
      \ home for the proper bacteria strains. Okay? Here's Type 2 diabetes mellitus,\
      \ and that's where I spent most of my career patient wise in medicine, was ankle\
      \ and foot for diabetes \u2026"
  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article discusses the science behind hydrogen-infused water and
      presents various claims about its therapeutic benefits based on numerous studies.
      However, it does so in a way that includes personal opinions and subjective
      language, such as questioning why this information isn't more widely reported
      in the news and expressing frustration about the focus on other topics. The
      author also uses informal language and rhetorical questions, which indicate
      a subjective viewpoint rather than a purely objective reporting of facts. While
      there are references to studies, the overall tone and structure suggest a strong
      personal opinion on the importance of this topic, making it less objective.
      Therefore, the article is classified as mostly subjective.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article is written in a conversational and opinionated style, with
      the author expressing frustration about the lack of media coverage on hydrogen-infused
      water. The language used is subjective, with phrases like "political crazy things"
      and "should it be on the news? Yes!" indicating a personal stance. The article
      does mention studies, but it does so in a way that suggests a bias towards the
      significance of hydrogen-infused water without providing balanced evidence or
      counterarguments. The focus is more on the author's opinion about the importance
      of the topic rather than neutrally presenting facts.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article primarily presents the comments of Russian Foreign Ministry
      Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova regarding Ukraine's proposal for consultations without
      Russia. It includes her critical perspective on Ukraine's actions and intentions,
      suggesting that they undermine the Minsk Accords. The language used is assertive
      and reflects a clear stance against Ukraine's proposal, indicating a subjective
      viewpoint. While it does provide factual information about the diplomatic context
      and historical agreements, the emphasis on Zakharova's opinions and the framing
      of Ukraine's actions as 'sabotage' suggests a lack of neutrality. Therefore,
      the article leans more towards subjectivity due to the strong opinions expressed
      and the lack of a balanced view that includes perspectives from Ukraine or other
      involved parties.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article primarily reports on statements made by Russian Foreign
      Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova regarding Ukraine's proposal to hold consultations
      without Russia. The article presents Zakharova's perspective and criticisms
      of Ukraine's actions, suggesting that Ukraine is attempting to undermine the
      Minsk Accords. The article includes factual information about the Budapest Memorandum
      and historical context regarding Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. However, the
      article is heavily focused on the Russian perspective and includes subjective
      language, such as "torpedoes the conflict's settlement" and "Kiev keeps shirking
      compliance," which indicates a bias towards the Russian viewpoint. The article
      does not provide a balanced view or include responses from Ukrainian officials
      or other involved parties, which would be necessary for a more objective report.
      Therefore, the article is mostly subjective as it presents a specific stance
      and opinion rather than a neutral, balanced report of facts.

    title: Ludicrous
    content: "Here are a few images that display the craziness we're being subjected\
      \ to.\nThanks to Mike McEvoy \u2026 "
  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: entirely subjective
    Reasoning: The title 'Ludicrous' suggests a strong opinion or judgment about the
      subject matter, indicating a lack of neutrality. The body of the article mentions
      'craziness' and implies a negative view of the situation being discussed. The
      use of the phrase 'we're being subjected to' further emphasizes a subjective
      perspective, as it conveys a sense of victimization or disapproval. Overall,
      the language used in both the title and body leans heavily towards expressing
      opinions rather than reporting factual news. Therefore, the article is classified
      as 'entirely subjective.'
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article titled "Ludicrous" seems to be presenting images that are
      described as displaying "craziness." The use of the word "craziness" suggests
      a subjective interpretation of the images, as it implies a judgment or opinion
      about the content being shown. Additionally, the phrase "we're being subjected
      to" indicates a perspective or stance that the author is taking, which is not
      neutral. The article does not appear to focus on reporting factual news in a
      neutral manner, but rather on expressing an opinion or viewpoint about the images.
      Therefore, the article is more subjective than objective.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents claims made by Melania Trump's former adviser
      regarding her views on migrant children in detention centers. It includes direct
      quotes and opinions attributed to Trump and her adviser, which suggests a subjective
      interpretation of her feelings and the situation. The article does not provide
      a balanced view or multiple perspectives on the issue, focusing instead on the
      claims made in the tell-all book. While it does report on factual events (the
      existence of detention centers and the family separation policy), the emphasis
      on personal opinions and interpretations leans towards subjectivity. Therefore,
      the article is not entirely objective, as it includes significant subjective
      elements and opinions rather than just factual reporting.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article is based on claims made by a former adviser and friend
      of Melania Trump, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, as reported in her memoir. The
      article presents these claims as the main content, which are inherently subjective
      as they reflect the opinions and interpretations of Wolkoff regarding Melania
      Trump's views. The article does not provide direct quotes from Melania Trump
      herself or any official statements, but rather relies on Wolkoff's account.
      Additionally, the article discusses Melania Trump's reactions to media criticism
      and her controversial jacket, which are also subjective topics. While the article
      does mention factual elements, such as the existence of the family separation

    Reasoning: The article presents statements made by Danish MEP Peter Kofod regarding
      the importance of maintaining trade relations with the UK post-Brexit. While
      it reports on a specific individual's comments, the language used is quite emotive

      of facts. The article does not provide a balanced view by including opposing
      opinions or a broader context, which further leans it towards subjectivity.

    Reasoning: The article presents statements made by Danish MEP Peter Kofod regarding
      the importance of maintaining trade relations between Denmark and the UK post-Brexit.
      The article quotes Mr. Kofod's opinions and desires for a trade agreement that
      respects the UK's sovereignty while maintaining close ties. The language used
      in the article, such as 'begged' and 'desperate', suggests a subjective tone,
      as it implies a certain level of emotion and urgency. Additionally, the article
      includes Mr. Kofod's personal views on the UK's decision to leave the EU and
      his hopes for future agreements, which are inherently subjective. While the
      article does report on a factual event (the EU parliament session on Brexit),
      the focus is on Mr. Kofod's opinions and the language used is not entirely neutral.
      Therefore, the article is not entirely objective, as it leans towards presenting
      subjective viewpoints and emotional language.

    title: Volkswagen Beetle Repurposed Into an Old-Fashioned Mini Bike
    content: "Here's how to transform the original VW Bug into a sweet mini-motorcycle\
      \ The original Volkswagen Beetle is one of the most popular vehicles of all\

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly objective
    Reasoning: The article describes a creative project involving the repurposing
      of Volkswagen Beetle parts into mini bikes. It provides factual information
      about the project, including details about the construction and features of
      the mini bikes. However, it also includes subjective language, such as describing
      the mini bikes as 'cute, one-eyed monsters' and referring to them as 'one of
      the coolest we've seen.' This indicates a level of personal opinion and enthusiasm
      from the author. While the article primarily focuses on reporting the facts
      of the project, the inclusion of subjective descriptions and opinions suggests
      that it is not entirely objective. Therefore, I would classify the article as
      'mostly objective' because it mainly presents factual information but includes
      some subjective elements.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article describes a creative project where a Volkswagen Beetle
      is repurposed into a mini-motorcycle. It provides factual information about
      the project, such as the parts used and the specifications of the mini-bikes.
      However, the language used in the article is quite subjective, with phrases
      like "one of the coolest we've seen" and "making them look like cute, one-eyed
      monsters." These expressions indicate a personal opinion or subjective view
      rather than a neutral, factual report. Additionally, the article encourages
      readers to check out the creator's Instagram, which adds a promotional tone.
      Therefore, while the article contains factual elements, the subjective language
      and promotional aspect make it more subjective overall.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a narrative that is heavily critical of the Chinese
      government and its officials, particularly Hua Chunying. It uses charged language
      such as "venomous propaganda" and "outlandish" to describe the Chinese response
      to U.S. events, which indicates a subjective viewpoint. The article also implies
      a moral judgment about the actions of the Chinese government, suggesting that
      they are hypocritical and manipulative. While it does report on factual events,
      such as tweets and statements made by officials, the overall tone and choice
      of words lean towards opinion rather than a neutral presentation of facts. Therefore,
      the article is not objective and leans more towards being subjective due to
      its critical stance and emotional language.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article uses loaded language and subjective descriptions, such
      as 'Hua's venomous propaganda' and 'reveling in the riots,' which indicate a
      strong bias against the Chinese Foreign Ministry's actions and statements. It
      also refers to the 'Chinese flu,' a term that is politically charged and not
      a neutral description of COVID-19. The article does not simply report facts
      but instead includes opinions and interpretations of the actions and statements
      of Chinese officials. This suggests that the article is not entirely objective,
      as it takes a clear stance against the Chinese Foreign Ministry and its representatives.
      The presence of subjective language and the focus on opinionated commentary
      over neutral reporting lead to the classification of the article as mostly subjective.

  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a strong emotional appeal against the use of mink
      fur in cosmetics, particularly fake eyelashes. It describes the conditions in
      which minks are kept and the methods of killing them in graphic detail, which
      indicates a subjective stance. The use of phrases like "terrible conditions"
      and "horrific industry" suggests a clear opinion against the practice, rather
      than a neutral reporting of facts. Additionally, the article references animal
      rights groups and their views, which further emphasizes its subjective nature.
      While it does provide some factual information about the treatment of minks,
      the overall tone and language used are heavily opinionated and aimed at persuading
      the reader against the use of mink fur in cosmetics. Therefore, the article
      is classified as mostly subjective.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article uses emotionally charged language and presents a strong
      stance against the use of mink fur in fake eyelashes. It describes the conditions
      in which minks are kept and killed in a very graphic and emotive manner, which
      indicates a subjective tone. The article also aligns with the views of animal
      rights groups like PETA, further suggesting a bias against the mink fur industry.
      While it may contain factual information about the conditions of mink farms,
      the language and presentation are not neutral, focusing on the negative aspects
      and urging readers to avoid certain products. This makes the article mostly
      subjective.

    Reasoning: The article presents a critical view of Jake Tapper's reporting on
      disinformation campaigns, suggesting that he is not fully truthful and is engaging
      in 'bothsiderism' by not adequately holding Republicans accountable for their
      actions. The language used is subjective, as it expresses opinions about Tapper's
      journalistic integrity and the implications of his reporting. The article does
      provide some factual examples of disinformation but primarily focuses on the
      author's critique of Tapper's approach, which indicates a subjective stance
      rather than an objective reporting of facts. Therefore, the article is not neutral
      and leans towards expressing personal opinions and criticisms.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article is largely subjective. It critiques Jake Tapper's approach
      to reporting on disinformation campaigns, suggesting that he fails to adequately
      hold Republicans accountable. The language used in the article, such as 'fails
      to tell the truth' and 'ingrained the whole idea of bothsiderism,' indicates
      a strong opinion against Tapper's perceived neutrality. The article does not
      simply report facts but instead provides an analysis and opinion on Tapper's
      reporting style and the broader issue of media balance. This focus on opinion
      and critique over neutral reporting makes the article mostly subjective.

    Reasoning: The title 'Immune System Resources' suggests a focus on providing information
      about the immune system, which leans towards an objective approach. However,
      the body of the article discusses 'Natural Immune Boosters for Kids' and includes
      advice on encouraging exercise and addressing stress to improve immunity. This
      implies a recommendation or opinion on what parents should do, which introduces
      a subjective element. The article does not strictly present facts but rather
      suggests actions based on beliefs about health and immunity. Therefore, while
      it contains factual information, it also includes subjective advice, making
      it not entirely objective.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article's title and body suggest that it is providing advice on
      how to boost children's immune systems naturally. This indicates that the article
      is likely offering health tips or recommendations, which can often be based
      on subjective opinions or interpretations of health data. The use of phrases
      like "Natural Immune Boosters" and "Power Up Their Defenses" suggests a focus
      on promoting certain actions or products, which can be subjective. Additionally,
      the article seems to be giving advice rather than reporting on factual news
      events, which leans towards subjectivity. Therefore, the article is likely to

    Reasoning: The article presents a clear bias against Bill Maher and Rick Wilson,
      labeling Maher as a "liberal blowhard" and using phrases like "virulent Never-Trumper"
      to describe Wilson. The language used is charged and subjective, indicating
      a strong opinion against the individuals mentioned. The article focuses on their
      statements about hoping for a recession to oust Trump, which is presented in
      a negative light. While it does reference factual statements made by Maher and
      Wilson, the overall tone and choice of words suggest a subjective stance rather
      than a neutral reporting of facts. Therefore, the article is not objective and
      leans towards being entirely subjective due to its use of derogatory language
      and the framing of the individuals' comments.
  GPT4o:

    Reasoning: The article is written in a subjective tone, using language that indicates
      bias, such as calling Bill Maher a "liberal blowhard" and referring to his comments

      and Rick Wilson, who are expressing their hopes for a recession to remove President

      CDC and its practices, particularly in relation to India. The use of phrases
      like "dark practice of using poor people in third world nations as guinea pigs"
      indicates a strong opinion against the CDC's actions. Additionally, the title
      "Too Little, Too Late?" implies a judgment about the timeliness and adequacy
      of India's response to the CDC. The article raises questions and suggests a
      perspective that may not be entirely neutral, leaning more towards a subjective
      interpretation of the events. Therefore, while it does report on factual events,
      the language and framing indicate a subjective stance.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article's title and body contain several indicators of subjectivity.
      The title itself, "Too Little, Too Late? India Stands Up to the CDC," suggests
      a critical stance and implies a judgment about the timing and actions of India
      in relation to the CDC. The body of the article uses loaded language, such as
      referring to the CDC as the "Centers for Disease Creation and Propaganda," which
      is a clear indication of bias and opinion rather than neutral reporting. Additionally,
      the article discusses the "dark practice of using poor people in third world
      nations as guinea pigs," which is a subjective statement that conveys a strong
      opinion. The use of rhetorical questions like "Wait, what?" and "So why is India
      watch listing the CDC?" further suggests a subjective tone, as they imply skepticism
      and lead the reader towards a particular viewpoint. Overall, the article does
      not maintain a neutral stance and is focused on expressing opinions and criticisms,
      making it mostly subjective.

      \ candidates. You might compare AOC to Jim DeMint, in that he was trying to\
      \ get more conservatives in the Senate just as AOC is trying to get more vocal\
      \ socialists into the House. DeMint rankled Senate GOP leadership just as \u2026\
      \ not giving to the DCCC. And, at least as far as tactics go, she's willing\
      \ to fight her party to get rid of the moderates just like DeMint did in the\
      \ Senate, which brought us Ted Cruz. The huge difference, however, is that DeMint\
      \ was trying to preserve the constitutional republic that the founders created\
      \ that is responsible for the very liberty we enjoy. AOC is actively trying\
      \ to destroy this republic, trying to turn is into a socialist nightmare that\
      \ will \u2026 worse if she succeeds \u2026"
  GPT4o-mini:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article presents a clear bias against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
      (AOC), using derogatory language such as "Deadbeat Cortez" and framing her actions
      in a negative light. It includes quotes from other Democrats expressing frustration
      with her, which adds to the subjective tone. The article also contrasts AOC's
      actions with those of Jim DeMint, suggesting a negative comparison without providing
      a balanced view of her perspective or the reasons behind her decisions. Overall,
      the language and framing indicate a strong opinion against AOC, making the article
      largely subjective rather than objective.
  GPT4o:
    Final Answer: mostly subjective
    Reasoning: The article is titled with a derogatory term "Deadbeat Cortez" and
      uses language that is clearly opinionated and negative towards AOC. It includes
      quotes from individuals who are critical of her, and the language used is not
      neutral. The article also makes a comparison between AOC and Jim DeMint, but
      then goes on to make a subjective claim that AOC is trying to "destroy this
      republic" and turn it into a "socialist nightmare." These statements are not
      factual reporting but rather opinions and interpretations. The article does
      report on some factual elements, such as AOC's refusal to pay DCCC dues and
      her reasons for doing so, but the overall tone and language are heavily opinionated
      and critical, making it mostly subjective.
